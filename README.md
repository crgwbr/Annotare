-- ## Why Annotare Exists ##

Hi, my name is Zach LeBar. And I am a nerd. Not simply a geek, but a full on, hardcore nerd. This file, it's written in a markup language designed by a guy named [John Gruber][gruber]. It's called [Markdown][md], and I write just about everything in its syntax. I think that qualifies me as a nerd. This file was created through the command line, and edited using [vim][vim]. I'm pretty sure that qualifies me as a nerd. I have an insatiable desire to be eagerly working on a "project" at all time. Go read [this][rands] article by Michael Lopp. He explains this phenomenon extremely well.

All of those are contributing factors to Annotare's creation. Annotare exists because I need a project. It's goals and purpose are tied up in my intense nerdiness. Annotare, at its heart, is simply a digital notebook. The concept is nothing new. It's been around since digital things were first created. But I've never been satisfied with any of the iterations out there of this idea, a "digital notebook". Because I'm a nerd, I've chosen to build my own version of the digital notebook. And I'm calling it Annotare.
